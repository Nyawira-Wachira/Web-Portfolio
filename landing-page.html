      <h2>List of Projects</h2>
      <p>Here is a list of some of the Projects I have done
        so far.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>hello-world</em></li>
          <p>This is the first ever code I've ever written,
            hence its title. It is written in HTML language</p>
          <p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/Nyawira-Wachira/hello-world"> hello world</a>
          </p>
        <li><em>my-first-webpage</em></li>
          <p>This was the first webpage I created. It has a few short statements and a list of items. The language 
            used is HTML.</p> 
          <p> Find it at <a href="https://github.com/Nyawira-Wachira/My-first-Webpage/blob/master/my-first-webpage.html">my-first-webpage</a>
        <li><em>inline-element</em></li>
        <p>This project is an updated version of my-first-webpage project. It
          contains inline elements like text emphasis, links and images done in HTML language.
        </p>
        <p>Look <a href="https://github.com/Nyawira-Wachira/inline-element/blob/master/Image-inline-element.html"> inline-element</a></p>
        <li><em>Git-Branching</em></li>
        <p>The project is about creating several copies of a code from the master branch.
          Git branching is done mostly to experiment with changes in the copies of code made, without interfering with the original code.
          It is written in HTML language.
