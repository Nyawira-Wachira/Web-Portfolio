    <h2><strong>About Me<strong></h2>
      <h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
      <p>My name is Abigail Wachira and I am a graduate from the Technical University of Kenya.
        I have a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (Telecommunication Major).
        I have worked in the Ministry of Public Works (Electrical Engineering department) as an intern. 
      </p>
      <p>I am passionate about Technology and Engineering because of the positive change that they 
        have brought into the world. It is for this reason that I decided to take a class on programming:
        because I want to be part of this change.
