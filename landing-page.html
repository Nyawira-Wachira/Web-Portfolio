      <p>Here is a list of some of the Projects I have done
        so far.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>hello-world</em></li>
        <p>This is the first ever code I've ever written,
          hence its title. It is written in HTML language</p>
        <p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/Nyawira-Wachira/hello-world"> hello world</a>
        </p>
        <li><em>my-first-webpage</em></li>
        <p>This was the first webpage I created. It has a few short statements and a list of items. The language 
          used is HTML.</p> 
        <p> Find it at <a href="https://github.com/Nyawira-Wachira/My-first-Webpage/blob/master/my-first-webpage.html">my-first-webpage</a>
        <li><em>inline-element</em></li>
        <p>This project is an updated version of my-first-webpage project. It
          contains inline elements like text emphasis, links and images.
        </p>
        <p>Look <a href="https://github.com/Nyawira-Wachira/inline-element/blob/master/Image-inline-element.html"> inline-element</a>
        <li><em>Git-Branching</em></li>
        <p>The project is about creating several copies of a code from the master branch.
          Git branching is done mostly to experiment with changes in the copies of code made, without interfering with the original code.
        </p>  
        </p>
      </ol>
